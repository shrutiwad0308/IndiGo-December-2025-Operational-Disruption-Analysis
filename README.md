 Airline Operations & Revenue Disruption Analytics – IndiGo (December 2025)

2.Short Description / Purpose

  This Airline Analytics Dashboard is designed to analyze flight cancellations, delays, and revenue impact during peak travel periods. The dashboard provides data-driven insights into operational disruptions faced by IndiGo Airlines in December 2025, helping airline management and stakeholders identify root causes, assess financial risk, and improve operational reliability.

3.Tech Stack

 Power BI – Data visualization & dashboard creation
 Power Query – Data cleaning and transformation
 DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) – KPIs and calculated measures
 Microsoft Excel / CSV – Raw data handling
 Synthetic Airline Operations Dataset – Flight-level operational data

4.Data Source

   Custom Synthetic Dataset (Airline Operations – December 2025)
 Flight-level data including:
   i)Flight status (On-Time / Delayed / Cancelled)
   ii)Delay duration
   iii)Route and airport details
   iv)Revenue metrics
   v)Event-day indicators 
   vi)Root causes of cancellations

5.Features / Highlights

 -> Business Problem
Airlines often face major challenges during peak travel seasons, such as:
High flight cancellation and delay rates
Operational breakdowns due to crew shortages and aircraft unavailability
Revenue loss from cancelled high-demand flights
Passenger disruption during time-sensitive events (e.g., cricket matches)
Without a centralized analytics dashboard, airline decisions become reactive rather than proactive, increasing customer dissatisfaction and financial risk.

 ->Goal of the Dashboard
Analyze flight cancellations and delays
Identify primary operational root causes
Monitor event-day impact on airline performance
Quantify revenue at risk due to disruptions
Enable data-driven operational and capacity planning decisions
